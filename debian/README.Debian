The package contains the default masterfiles with simple configuration as
provided by CFEngine. It is only slightly patched to work with a directory
structure other than /var/cfengine.

You should install this package only on the policy server and only if you are
creating a new policy set. The package files land in
/usr/share/doc/cfengine3/masterfiles but if your /var/lib/cfengine3/masterfiles
is empty, those default configuration files will be copied there as well for
your convenience.
